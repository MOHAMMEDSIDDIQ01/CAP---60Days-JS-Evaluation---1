# Employee Management System
Overview
This Employee Management System is a web application that allows users to view, filter, sort, and paginate employee data. It utilizes an API to fetch employee information and provides a user-friendly interface for managing the data.

# Features
1. Fetching Employee Data
The system fetches employee data from the API endpoint and displays it in a tabular format on the web page. Each row in the table represents an employee and includes details such as Serial Number, Name, Gender, Department, and Salary.

2. Filtering
Filter by Department
Users can filter employees based on their department using a dropdown menu. Available departments include HR, Finance, Marketing, Engineering, and Operations.

Filter by Gender
Another dropdown menu allows users to filter employees by gender, with options for Male, Female, and Others.

3. Sorting
Users can sort the displayed data based on employee salaries. The sorting options include ascending (low to high) and descending (high to low) order.

4. Pagination
The system implements pagination to manage large datasets. Users can navigate through pages of employee data, with each page showing a limited number of entries (e.g., 10 entries per page). The Previous and Next buttons are disabled appropriately based on the current page to enhance usability.

5. User Interface Improvements
The UI is designed for a seamless user experience. It includes clear dropdown menus for filtering and sorting, intuitive pagination controls, and disabled navigation buttons for better navigation flow.
